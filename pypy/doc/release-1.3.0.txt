PyPy 1.3: Stabilization
=======================

Hello.

We're please to announce release of PyPy 1.3. This release has two major
points. First of all, we stabilized the JIT compiler since 1.2 release,
answered user issues, fixed bugs and generally improved speed.

On the other hand, we're pleased to announce alpha support for loading
CPython extension modules written in C. While the main point of the release
is increased stability, this part is in alpha stage and  it is not yet suited
for production environments.

Highlight of this release
=========================

XXX a rough list
- cpyext
- bugfixes
- blackhole-improvements
- minor jit improvements

PyPy 1.3: Stabilization
=======================

Hello.

We're please to announce release of PyPy 1.3. This release has two major
points. First of all, we stabilized the JIT compiler since 1.2 release,
answered user issues, fixed bugs and generally improved speed.

The other point is that we're pleased to announce alpha support for loading
CPython extension modules written in C. While the main point of the release
is increased stability, this part is in alpha stage and it is not yet suited
for production environments.

Highlight of this release
=========================

* We introduce support for CPython extension modules written in C. As of now,
  this support is in alpha and it's very unlikely untried modules will work
  out of the box, due to missing functions or refcounting details. The support
  is disable by default, so you have to do::

   import cpyext

  before trying to import any .so file. Also, libraries are source-compatible
  and not binary-compatible. That means you need to recompile binaries, using
  for example::

   python setup.py build

  Details may vary, depending on your build system. Make sure you include
  the above line at the beginning of setup.py or put it in your PYTHONSTARTUP.

  This is alpha feature, it'll likely segfault, you have been warned.

* JIT bugfixes. A lot of bugs reported for JIT and not only has been fixed
  and it's stability greatly improved since 1.2 release.

* Various JIT improvements. Various small improvements have been added to the
  JIT code, together with great speedup of compiling time.

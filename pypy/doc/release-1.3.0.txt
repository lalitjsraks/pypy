PyPy 1.3: Stabilization
=======================

Hello.

We're please to announce release of PyPy 1.3. This release has two major
points. First of all, we stabilized status of JIT compiler after 1.2
release, answering user issues, fixing bugs and generally improving speed.

On the other hand, we're pleased to announce alpha support for loading
CPython extension modules written in C. While the main point of the release
is increased stability, this part is in alpha stage and as is, it's not suited
for production environment.

Highlight of this release
=========================

XXX a rough list
- cpyext
- bugfixes
- blackhole-improvements
- minor jit improvements
